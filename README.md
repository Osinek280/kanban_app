# Kanban app
The Kanban app is a project designed to help users organize their tasks efficiently using Kanban boards. Users can add tasks to separate Kanbans, manage their progress through different sections, and edit task details such as descriptions, categories, and priority levels. This application is built using Next.js 14, TypeScript, CSS Modules, bcryptjs for password hashing, react-beautiful-dnd for drag-and-drop functionality, and MongoDB for database management.
